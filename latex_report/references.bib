	abstract = {Objective: Harmonized data quality ({DQ}) assessment terms, methods, and reporting
            practices can establish a common understanding of the strengths and limitations of
            electronic health record ({EHR}) data for operational analytics, quality improvement, and
            research. Existing published {DQ} terms were harmonized to a comprehensive unified
            terminology with definitions and examples and organized into a conceptual framework to
            support a common approach to defining whether {EHR} data is ‘fit’ for specific
            uses.Materials and Methods: {DQ} publications, informatics and analytics experts, managers
            of established {DQ} programs, and operational manuals from several mature {EHR}-based
            research networks were reviewed to identify potential {DQ} terms and categories. Two
            face-to-face stakeholder meetings were used to vet an initial set of {DQ} terms and
            definitions that were grouped into an overall conceptual framework. Feedback received
            from data producers and users was used to construct a draft set of harmonized {DQ} terms
            and categories. Multiple rounds of iterative refinement resulted in a set of terms and
            organizing framework consisting of {DQ} categories, subcategories, terms, definitions, and
            examples. The harmonized terminology and logical framework’s inclusiveness was evaluated
            against ten published {DQ} terminologies.Results: Existing {DQ} terms were harmonized and
            organized into a framework by defining three {DQ} categories: (1) Conformance (2)
            Completeness and (3) Plausibility and two {DQ} assessment contexts: (1) Verification and
            (2) Validation. Conformance and Plausibility categories were further divided into
            subcategories. Each category and subcategory was defined with respect to whether the
            data may be verified with organizational data, or validated against an accepted gold
            standard, depending on proposed context and uses. The coverage of the harmonized {DQ}
            terminology was validated by successfully aligning to multiple published {DQ}
            terminologies.Discussion: Existing {DQ} concepts, community input, and expert review
            informed the development of a distinct set of terms, organized into categories and
            subcategories. The resulting {DQ} terms successfully encompassed a wide range of disparate
            {DQ} terminologies. Operational definitions were developed to provide guidance for
            implementing {DQ} assessment procedures. The resulting structure is an inclusive {DQ}
            framework for standardizing {DQ} assessment and reporting. While our analysis focused on
            the {DQ} issues often found in {EHR} data, the new terminology may be applicable to a wide
            range of electronic health data such as administrative, research, and patient-reported
            data.Conclusion: A consistent, common {DQ} terminology, organized into a logical
            framework, is an initial step in enabling data owners and users, patients, and policy
            makers to evaluate and communicate data quality findings in a well-defined manner with a
            shared vocabulary. Future work will leverage the framework and terminology to develop
            reusable data quality assessment and reporting methods.},
